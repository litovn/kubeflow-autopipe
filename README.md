# Kubeflow Autopipe
Kubeflow Autopipe is a pipeline tool designed to streamline the process of video processing and analysis by leveraging the power of Kubeflow components, addressing each stage in the ML lifecycle. This tool help with the orchestration of a series of components to automate the workflow of video processing, from initial ingestion through various transformations and analysis, to final output.

To achieve this automation, Kubeflow Autopipe utilizes a modular component system, allowing users to define a sequence of components and their dependencies through a configuration file. This flexibility enables users to customize the pipeline according to their specific requirements, making it easy to adapt the pipeline to different use cases.

When deploying AI and ML based workloads on a cluster, you need to install several tools separately to get the job done. To install all the necessary tools on our cluster with one stack, we will be using deployKF.
Much like Kubeflow, deployKF gives you a collection of resources to deploy on your Kubernetes cluster to ensure that you have everything you need to begin pipelining. The biggest difference conceptually is that deployKF combines Kubeflow with a few other tools to make the entirety of managing the cluster from an AI and ML perspective a bit easier.

## Features

- **Automated Video Processing Pipeline**: Simplifies the process of video processing by automating the workflow through a predefined sequence of components.
- **Modular Component System**: Utilizes a series of components including `ffmpeg` for video processing, `librosa` for audio analysis, `deepspeech` for speech-to-text conversion, and an `object-detector` for detecting objects within video frames.
- **Flexible Workflow Configuration**: Allows for easy customization of the pipeline through the `application_dag.yaml` configuration file, enabling users to define their own sequence of components and dependencies.
- **Large File Support**: Integrates with Git LFS to handle large files such as ONNX models, PBMM files, and scorer files, ensuring efficient management and versioning of large assets.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kubeflow Autopipe, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/litovn/kubeflow-components.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   Ensure you have Docker installed and configured. Use the provided `.env` file to set your Docker credentials.
3. **Configure the Pipeline**:
   Edit the `application_dag.yaml` file to customize the pipeline according to your needs. Specify the input media, components, and their dependencies.
4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Execute the pipeline using Kubeflow. Detailed instructions on running the pipeline in a Kubeflow environment will depend on your specific Kubeflow setup.

## Configuration

The pipeline's behavior is configured through the `application_dag.yaml` file. This YAML file defines the system's name, the input media path, the components involved in the processing, and the dependencies between these components.
